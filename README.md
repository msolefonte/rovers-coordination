# Rovers Coordination Project

Wireless coordination algorithms applied to Mars rovers.

## About the project

The objective of this project is to design, implement and
build a peer-to-peer networking protocol applied to Mars
rovers. In order to do so, a Software Defined Network is
utilized in order to simulate the wireless environment,
unreliable and with constant topology changes.

Apart from the core, a list of components have been added
in order to simulate a sufficiently realistic environment.
This includes but is not limited to radios, antennas,
engines, batteries and sensors, all of them with automated
failures associated in order to evaluate the algorithm
fault-tolerance capacities.

## Usage

**Start*
```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

**Stop**
```bash
./scripts/stop.sh
```
